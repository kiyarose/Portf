# Expected LHCI Warnings

This document lists warnings that are expected and acceptable when running Lighthouse CI.

## 1. GitHub Token Not Set

```
⚠️   GitHub token not set
```

**Status:** Expected and acceptable
**Reason:** This warning appears in local runs and CI environments without a GitHub token configured. It does not affect Lighthouse audits.
**Action:** No action needed.

## 2. Server Startup Timeout Warning

```
WARNING: Timed out waiting for the server to start listening.
         Ensure the server prints a pattern that matches /listen|ready/i when it is ready.
```

**Status:** Cosmetic warning only
**Reason:** Vite's preview server outputs "Local: http://localhost:..." which doesn't match LHCI's default pattern. However, the server starts successfully and Lighthouse runs complete without issues.
**Action:** Documented in `.lighthouserc.cjs`. The warning can be ignored as it doesn't affect functionality.

## 3. Performance Score Warnings

```
⚠️  categories.performance warning for minScore assertion
        expected: >=0.8
           found: <0.8
```

**Status:** Intentional configuration
**Reason:** Performance is configured as a "warn" level (not "error") in `.lighthouserc.cjs`. This allows monitoring performance without blocking PRs for minor regressions.
**Action:** Review performance metrics and optimize when feasible, but warnings are acceptable.

## 4. Network Upload Errors (Local Only)

```
Error while fetching previous urlMap: request to https://us-central1-lighthouse-infrastructure.cloudfunctions.net/...
```

**Status:** Expected in local/restricted network environments
**Reason:** LHCI attempts to upload results to temporary public storage, which may fail in restricted networks.
**Action:** No action needed for local development. CI environment should have proper network access.
